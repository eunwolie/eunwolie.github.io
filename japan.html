		<h3> June 11 - June 12: Tokyo </h3>
		<p> We will be arriving first at the Tokyo airport on the 10th of June. As such, we were planning to rest up and start or trip on the 11th.  
			We will first start off going  around Tokyo to observe so more popular places. As such we are planning to go to </p>
		<ul>
			<li> Tokyo Skytree </li>
			<li> Akihabara </li>
			<li> Shinjuku </li>
			<li> Meiji Shrine </li>
			<li> Ueno </li>
			<li> Yoyogi Park </li>
		</ul>
		<p> Listed above are popular tourist spots in Tokyo. 
			There are areas in the list which are known for their unique shopping experience, 
			and others which are known for allowing people to rest and find inner peace.
			As there is such an extensive lists of things for just two days in Tokyo, 
			we are unsure at this point if we will be cutting down on the number of destinations and which ones to cut out. 
		</p>
		<h3> June 13 - June 14: Mt. Fuji </h3>
		<p> We will be travelling to Mt. Fuji with the thought of following the hiking trail up the mountain. 
			As none of us are experienced hikers, we are unsure of how feasible this will be. More research will be done on this part. 
			But at the very least, we will take pictures and experience the ammentities offered at the foot of the mountain. 
		</p>		
    		<h3> June 15 - June 16: Kyoto </h3>
		<ul>
			<li> Kin and Ginkakuji </li>
			<li> Nijo Castle </li>
			<li> Fushimi-Inari Taisha Shrine </li>
			<li> Kiyomizu-dera Temple </li>
			<li> Gion </li>
		</ul>
		<p> Kyoto has plenty to offer in terms of buildings and castles of historical significance. 
			As such, we will be taking a more relaxed portion to the trip by visiting the castles and shrines Kyoto has to offer.
		</p>
    		<h3> June 17 - June 18: Nara </h3>
		<p> We currently have no fixed plans for Nara, but having heard that there is some beautiful artwork around the area,
			we are sure we will be entertained for two days. 
		</p>
    		<h3> June 19 - June 20: Osaka </h3>
		<p> We also do not have any fixed plans for Osaka. However, we have heard that the food experience in Osaka is a must try.
