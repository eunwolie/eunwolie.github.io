		<p> Although we are leaving Japan to head to Korea, we anticipate this to be a short delay in our journey. 
			The travel between Japan and Korea has been touted to be a short and easy trip by plane taking about 3 hours. 
			That’s the distance between Calgary and Vancouver!

		<h3> June 21 - June 22: Busan </h3>
		<p> We are going to first visit Busan which is known as a beautiful beach area and a must see for many. 
			We are headed there to visit my friend’s family in addition to enjoying all the fresh seafood this region has to offer. We will be heading to his grandparent’s house to allow him to meet with them. 
			Our friend currently resides here in Calgary with his family and is happy to be travelling back to see them as he hasn’t been able to for a while. Being a college student is busy!

		<h3> June 23 - June 24: Cheongju </h3>
		<p> We will then be heading to Cheongju so that my boyfriend can meet his family. 
			Despite having spent his early childhood living in Seoul, before having moved to Calgary, his father currently lives in Cheongju. 
			This is his hometown and is also where is family is currently living. 
			While we have not made a concrete plan about what is happening during these few days, we were told that this regions is known for its vast variety of foods.

		<h3> June 25 - June 28: Seoul </h3>
		<p> Our final days will be spent in Seoul, which is the capital of South Korea. 
			Seoul is a metropolitan area which allows us to do some shopping before heading home. 
			This is especially great for me as I am interested in a couple products that are only produced in Korea. 
			Often, the shipping makes it too expensive for me to purchase the product in Canada.
