  <h1> City of Stars </h1>
  <p> I have chosen to do a net art piece that makes use of IP addresses and the amount of files transferred over the internet to colour the art piece. 
    I have selected to make an art piece that grabs the IP address for the source and destination to colour in a darkened city line. 
    By drawing the IP addresses from a created database that lists the address linked to a location, we are able to store the skyline image for each city were have created a silouhette for.
    After we pull out the skyline image from the database, we can start to colour it with the amount of files that have been transferred over the internet with similar positional IP addresses. 
  </p>
  <p> This art piece relies very heavily on the creation or utilization of already created databases that link source and destination addresses to specific cities and 
        files to these addresses. Any files that have experienced collisions and/or corruption will be filtered out. 
        Only files that have been successfully transferred will be considered for data in this art piece. 
  </p>
  <p> Each file will represent a bright colourful miniscule dot found on the page. These dots will replace any random black dots on the page until the city line is full. 
  Once it is full, instead of outlining already bright buildings, these dots will then translate into stars in the sky. 
  The size of these files do matter as it will determine the size of the dot placed on the page. Not all dots will be of uniform size.
