      	<p> Above is a picture of me and my friends. 
		While I have been friends with half of them since high school, it was really in university that we got closer. 
		We’ve all been friends from first and second year and many of them are now graduating and progressing to the next part of their lives. 
		The other half will continue to be in school with me as we work hard to graduate. So for many of us, this will be a graduation trip. 
		We’ve chosen to go to Asia as a big majority of us have family in the area, in addition, as many of us have expressed interest in the culture. 
		There was no doubt that this was going to be one of the first areas we visit together. 
		We’re hoping this trip will be a successful one.
