  <h1> Gravity Bone: Write a description of the actions you take and their results as you move through it (don't do it later, it won't work properly). From this create a description of the branches the story takes as a function of your choices. </h1>   
  <p> Playthrough 1. We arrive at an area with several people crowding around each other in something that resemebles an elevator. There are servers with drink trays in their hand indicating we are at a party.
  On the right is a sign indicating the control keys for the game. We wander around until another set of instructions appears indicating we may open doors and interact with objects with the E key on our keyboard. 
  The a task card appears on the screen indicating I should find a furnace room. I try to use the newly discovered E key to interact with people only to be greeted with a curt "hi" by many. 
  I decide these characters are not important and that I should go open doors to find a way to the furnace room. I try the E button at the exit door to find that it is locked. 
  I then see a server open a door and I follow him inside. This leads to a hallway with the furnace room clearly indicated by an arrow on the wall. I follow the arrow to a door which I try to open. 
  The door opens successfully where I see another sign that idndicates I may use the spacebar to jump. As the only item that seems to be something I can jump on is the sink, I try to jump of the sink. 
  I change my view around using the mouse to see that I am able to jump on a platform to the right of the sink. I jump of the platform to discover a suitcase. 
  </p>
  <p> I open the suitcase to see I have been given the mission to deliver the drink provided to a man with red hair. I press E to interact with the drink and a suit provided right beside it.
  I exit the furnace room as there seems to be nothing else there and move back to the party area. I try to wander up the stairs to try to find a man with red hair. 
  I see a man with red hair and a red suit on the top floor and press E to deliver the drink to him. 
  He consumes the drink where I am alerted by a dialog on the screen that I should find an exit. I go back downstairs where I had previously seen an exit and try the door again. 
  It now opens and I enter. It seems as I have completed the mission successfully as the screen play a video about why I was given the task to provide this mysterious drink to the man with red hair. 
  </p>
  <p> I am again sent to another area in a container that resembles an elevator. I exit to see four people: three men with dark suits and a female with a white shirt.
  I interact with all of them to be greeted with a short hi. I am again directed to go to the furnace room with a memo card that displays on the screen. 
  I move around try to interact with a door that would open. The first two double doors that I try do not open. I move around the corner to try to open a single door and it opens.
  I find myself in the furnace room and try to jump down from the ledge as there is nothing on the main floor and I accidentally die as I am squished by one of the large moving columns.
  </p>
  <p> Playthrough 2. I continue from the furnace room making sure not to get squished by the columns. I arrive in a corner to the left of the columns that do not contain anything. 
  I change the player perspective using the mouse to discover another room past the columns behind the barrier. I hurriedly try to go past a single column as it rises and jump over the barrier.
  I reach another spacious room with another briefcase, a hammer and some kind of spray. I use the hammer to open the briefcase and I open the briefcase to be greeted with a mission to take pictures of five birds.
  I wander around the room and to discover and exit and a camera. I exit the room after obtaining the camera to a dark hallway with several doors with locks in them. I try the hammer first to no avail, and then try a combination of the spray and hammer that succeeds with opening the first door. 
  Inside I find a black bird which I take a picture of with the camera. The bird then explodes. I exit the room and continue to the room beside where I find another bird that I take a picture of. 
  I exit the hallway to find a red room that I open in the same manner to find a bird. As I was unable to open the other doors, I try to jump down from the ledge outside and accidentally die.

  <h1> 1. How does the allowed interaction keep the narrative on track? How does it permit variations and branches? </h1>
  <p>The controls for Gravity Bone are straight forward such that the player is allowed to move forwards, backwards, left and right.
  They are also able to use the mouse to rotate their view in the game. 
  In some instances, the player is able to interact with important objects and doors using the E key on the keyboard and jump onto objects using the spacebar key. 
  While the game does allow for variation and branching, these are minimal as players are given a goal they try to achieve in order to complete the game.
  Therefore, players only have two ways of completing the game. 
  That is, to successfullly finish the tasks in the game and reach the narrative ending of the game or to fail to complete the tasks and end the game prematurely by accidentally killing oneself in the game. 
  By providing only two options the narrative stays on track as players of the game may decide to continue from a failed game in order to complete the story or they can quit the game altogether. 
  </p>
  
  <h1> 2. Describe the nature of the graphical quality and how it is relevant to the story.  </h1>
  <p> The graphics for this game are very simple. The background characters in the game are blocky and dressed in darker clothing.
  This is relevant to the story as it allows us to focus on the tasks at hand (which usually include finding the furnace room for every task) 
  and to takes note of key characters (such as the man with red hair and the female spy) as we move through the narrative.
  After looking up the game online, it should be noted that the creator wanted the game to be short and easy to complete in about 20 minutes. 
  The graphics do help with that as they do not distract the player from the goals of the game by wanting to wander aimlessly to explore other areas of the game. 
  </p>
  
  <h1> 3. Describe the nature of the interaction and how it influences choices and how the player feels.  </h1>
  <p> The maps in the game are small and allow for very little interaction with the controls provided. 
  By minimalizing the interactions in the map and keeping the interactions between the player and background characters short and curt, 
  it makes the player feel isolated and determined to completed their goals. 
  The bright red lighting in the furnace room and occasionally some doors of the game makes the player feel wary and that they are doing something dangerous.
  At the same time, this red lighting was purposefully selected to direct the player towards completing their goals. 
  There is also very minimal interaction with physical objects in the game such that only objects important to the mission given may be piced up and used. 
  As such, when a player interacts with the object, the player instunctively knows that this object must be used to complete the task given.
